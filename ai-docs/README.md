# AI Documentation

This directory serves as a knowledge repository for AI tools and assistants working with this codebase. It contains project-specific documentation that helps AI tools understand our implementation details, patterns, and conventions.

## Purpose

- Provide instant context to AI tools about project-specific implementations
- Document project conventions that may not be immediately obvious from the codebase
- Serve as a persistent knowledge base for AI assistants
- Facilitate faster and more accurate AI assistance

## Directory Structure

- `/project`: Overall project architecture and conventions
- `/components`: Component patterns and usage guidelines
- `/styling`: Tailwind and styling conventions
- `/data-fetching`: Server actions and data fetching patterns
- `/pages`: Page structure and routing
- `/integrations`: Third-party integrations (if applicable)
- `/deployment`: Deployment and environment information

## Maintenance

This documentation should be updated whenever:
- New conventions are established
- Significant architectural changes are made
- New integration patterns are implemented

The goal is to keep this documentation concise yet comprehensive, focusing on information that helps AI tools understand project-specific details rather than general programming concepts.
