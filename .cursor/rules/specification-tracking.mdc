# Specification Tracking

When implementing features that are part of a formal specification, this workflow must be followed to ensure proper tracking and adherence to the plan.

## Process

1. **Check for Specification First**: Before implementing any significant feature, ask "Am I following a specification?" If yes, locate the specification document (typically in `ai-docs/[feature-name]-specification.md`).

2. **Review Current Tasks**: Identify which specific tasks from the implementation checklist you're currently working on.

3. **Follow the Plan**: Implement the feature according to the architecture, data models, and technical requirements outlined in the specification.

4. **Update Progress**: After completing each task or subtask:
   - Mark the corresponding checkbox as complete in the specification document
   - Add any implementation notes that might be helpful for future reference
   - Format: `- [x] Completed task <!-- Implemented on [date] using [approach] -->`

5. **Handle Changes**: If implementation details need to differ from the specification:
   - Document the change reason directly in the specification
   - Update any affected sections of the specification to reflect the new approach
   - Format: `<!-- Change: [description of change] Reason: [justification] -->`

6. **Cross-Reference**: When committing code related to specification tasks, reference the specification section in commit messages.

## Example Tracking Update

```markdown
### Phase 1: Setup & Configuration
- [x] Install Payload CMS and dependencies <!-- Implemented on 2023-06-01 using Bun instead of npm -->
  - [x] `payload`
  - [x] `@payloadcms/next`
  - [x] `mongodb`
  - [x] `dotenv`
- [ ] Create `.env` file with required variables
```

## Guidelines for AI Assistance

When an AI assistant is asked to help with specification tasks:

1. The AI should first identify if the request relates to a specification document
2. If yes, the AI should:
   - Locate and review the relevant specification
   - Identify which tasks are being addressed
   - Implement according to the specification guidelines
   - Recommend updating the progress tracking in the specification
   - If changes are needed, suggest specific updates to the specification
