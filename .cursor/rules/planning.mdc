If you are being asked to plan anything, use these steps.

Propose a plan to solve this.
Use best practices: 
  - @Web 
  - Docs included in the workspace
Use the rules: @coding-pattern-prefrences.mdc 
Order of operations:
1. Describe your changes in a numbered list.
2. For each number you're going to specify something you want to apply or append to the document, explaing the reason for the mutation and showing the code change.
3. Then continuing the number you'll specify mutations 1 by 1, explaining the reason for the mutation and showing the code change..
4. Lastly for the change description process, you're going to do the same thing but with line deletions. So for each line deletion, you'll explain yourself then show the change.
4. Then you will cohesively prepare the contextual change document in your plan.
```
+ some cool shit
+ some cool shit

...original implementation here.

- some dog shit
- some more dog shit

+ Beautiful ducks in a line
- Left pocket dog shit
+ Beautiful ducks in a line
+ Beautiful ducks in a line

... the other shit at the end of the file.
```

After the user confirms the plan, store it into your thinking MCP server so you can preserve the order and nuance of the planning.
