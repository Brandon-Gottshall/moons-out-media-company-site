# Specification-First Development

For any major feature addition, system integration, or architectural change, a formal specification document must be created and approved before implementation begins.

## Process

1. **Identify Need**: Determine that a change requires formal specification (typically any feature that will take >1 day to implement)

2. **Create Specification Document**: Structure as follows:
   - Overview/Purpose
   - Architecture/Components 
   - Data Models/Schemas
   - Implementation Plan
   - Technical Requirements
   - Migration Strategy (if applicable)
   - Success Criteria

3. **Develop Implementation Checklist**: Create a detailed, phased checklist with:
   - Major phases of work
   - Individual tasks within each phase
   - Subtasks where needed
   - Use markdown checkboxes for progress tracking

4. **Review and Approval**: Get stakeholder sign-off before beginning implementation

5. **Track Progress**: Use the checklist during implementation to track progress

## Template

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Specification

## 1. Overview
[Brief description of what this feature/system is and why it's needed]

## 2. Architecture
[Description of technical architecture, components, and how they interact]

## 3. Data Models
[Define data structures, schemas, relationships]

## 4. Implementation Plan
[High-level implementation approach and strategy]

### 4.1 [Phase 1]
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

### 4.2 [Phase 2]
[...]

## 5. Technical Requirements
[Dependencies, environment variables, performance considerations, security requirements]

## 6. Migration Strategy (if applicable)
[How to migrate from existing system/data to the new implementation]

## 7. Success Criteria
[How will we know when this implementation is successful?]

## 8. Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: [Phase Name]
- [ ] [Task 1]
  - [ ] [Subtask 1.1]
  - [ ] [Subtask 1.2]
- [ ] [Task 2]
- [ ] [Task 3]

### Phase 2: [Phase Name]
- [ ] [Task 1]
- [ ] [Task 2]
[...]
